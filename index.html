        <p>The <em>HTML</em> specification includes <span>the concept of an outline formed by the use of</span> elements.
            If this were implemented it would enable the use of multiple elements, 
            giving user agents—including screen readers—a way to understand that an 
            nested inside a defined section is a subheading. This functionality has never been 
            implemented; therefore it is important to use your headings to describe the outline 
            of your document.</p>
